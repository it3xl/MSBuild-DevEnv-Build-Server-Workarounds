@SET operation=MSBuild: Preventing File System Redirector fail.
@ECHO START: %operation%
  @REM This workaround is actual if your run unde Local System.
  @REM
  @REM For any build under system local account (Local System for our Build-Server's Win Service) there is a bug for implicit switching
  @REM  from C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile to C:\Windows\SysWOW64\config\systemprofile\AppData
  @REM A workaround for this is to use x64 MSBuild but we have no this option for the DevEnv calling.
  @REM
  @REM It is important to modify the CMD environment by this workaround before call of the MSBuild or DevEnv Command Prompt.
  @REM VsDevCmd.bat will install some .NET stuff into a current AppData.
  @REM And possibly DevEnv will be using of C:\Windows\system32\... again for the Local System account.
